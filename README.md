# Java Project - a betting card

In this project, I simulated a betting card game that is somewhat like KENO, but in a different way along with using other javaFX elements to make it look appealing. There is a title screen that shows options and instructions that are clickable, then once you start you're taken into a different screen that shows you the numbers you are able to select. You're also able to select multiple cards to increase your chances, as well. There's a rewards screen that fades in to show how much the user has won.
